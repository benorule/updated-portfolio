# updated-portfolio
Link to deployed application: https://benorule.github.io/updated-portfolio/

This webpage is my portfolio of my most recent projects. 

This webpage uses the CSS framework Skeleton. 

I used the grid system of the Skeleton framework to design the website.
I made the first row containing the title and two buttons with links to my GitHub and Linkedin pages.
I made the second row containing a short bio and links to my email and resume.
In the rows below I made a table to display my portfolio. The first column has the title, the second column has a description and the third column has a button that opens the deployed application.
