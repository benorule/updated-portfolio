# updated-portfolio
Link to deployed application: https://benorule.github.io/updated-portfolio/

This webpage is my portfolio of my most recent projects. 

This webpage uses the CSS framework Skeleton. 

I used the grid system of the Skeleton framework to design the website.
I made the first row containing the title and two buttons with links to my GitHub and Linkedin pages.
I made the second row containing a short bio and links to my email and resume.
In the rows below I made a table to display my portfolio. The first column has the title, the second column has a description and the third and fourth column buttons.
The button in the third column opens a modal window and the button pressed determines the source of the image shown in that modal window. I used a skeleton class to make it change size based on device used.
The button in the fourth column opens in a new tab the deployed application on GitHub pages.
